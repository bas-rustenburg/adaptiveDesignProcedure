# adaptiveDesignProcedure

A design procedure of the training data for Machine Learning algorithms able to iteratively add datapoints according to function discrete gradient.

## Authors:
**adaptiveDesignProcedure** is developed and mantained at the Laboratory of Catalysis and Catalytic Process of Politecnico di Milano by Dr. Mauro Bracconi (mauro.bracconi@polimi.it) under the [ERC SHAPE](http://www.shape.polimi.it/) project held by Prof. Matteo Maestri

## Installation:
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/mbracconi/adaptiveDesignProcedure.git
```
Change directory:
```
cd adaptiveDesignProcedure
```
The **adaptiveDesignProcedure** class is in the adaptiveDesignProcedure.py file
